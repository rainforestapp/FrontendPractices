# State Management

There are several methods to store application state, depending on how long the state should be persisted, some methods are more suitable than others.

## Component Local State

## Local Storage

Use [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store state that should persist accross user sessions, but not important enough to store in the db (eg. page sizes when showing paginated lists). Local storage is not reliable, since [it's not always available](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API#Feature-detecting_localStorage) and can be cleared out by users / extensions for various reasons. We should treat local storage usage as progressive enhancement, meaning the app should still work when local storage is not available on the userâ€™s browser for whatever reason and should behave sensibly.

Because of this limitation, local storage should only be used to store default values when initializing components. After a component is initialized, it may continue to update the local storage state, but it should not read / be controlled directly by the local storage state.
