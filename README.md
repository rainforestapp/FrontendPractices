# React Best Practices and Conventions

React.js is unopinionated. This is smart. It gives the open source community room to shape react-development.

Conventions are important. For developing at scale. For efficiency/speed. For making life easier for new developers.

This is an attempt at defining best practices for development with React, based on lessons learnt developing our [QA Testing Platform](https://www.rainforestqa.com/), Rainforest QA. Everybody is invited to contribute, just open a pull request.

__Please note__: All the JavaScript examples in this documentation contain [es6](http://es6-features.org/) or newer.
For starters, you should install all our recommended [tools](Tooling.md).
